okay reading this has actually been helpful
I'm still a little hazy on all the typing rules of cic, I guess mostly that they seem to be not as complex as I would assume them to be. honestly the coq reference is almost certainly a better place to understand all of that.

however now that I actually understand metacoq and how to use it, I intend to use it to play around with a simpler way of declaring everything, such as a `type A = ` oriented way of doing things
