> One of the key ingredients to the concision, and intelligibility, of a mathematical
text is the use of notational conventions and even sometimes the abuse thereof.
These notational conventions are usually shaped by decades of practice by the
specialists of a given mathematical community. If some conventions may vary
according to the authorâ€™s taste, most tend to stabilize into a well-established
common practice. A trained reader can hence easily infer from the context of a
typeset mathematical formula he is reading all the information that is not explicit
in the formula but that is nonetheless necessary to the precise description of the
mathematical objects at stake.
Formalizing a page of mathematics using a proof assistant requires the description of objects and proofs at a level of detail that is few orders of magnitude
higher than the one at which a human reader would understand this description.
This paper is about the techniques that can be used to reproduce at the formal
level the ease authors of mathematics have to omit some part of the information
they would need to provide, because it can be inferred. In the context of a large
scale project like the formal proof of the Odd Order Theorem, which involves
a large and broad panel of algebraic theories that should be both developed
and combined, a faithful imitation of these practices becomes of crucial importance. Without them, the user of the proof assistant is soon overwhelmed by the
long-windedness of the mathematical statements at stake.

nope, because computers. in a tool with first-class metaprogramming, we can have both.

also, because we can *locally* rename or alias symbols, we can have *explicit and local* terseness without requiring a globally useless name



more than one name for the same thing
there shouldn't be more than one way to do the same thing!
if a syntax sugar exists for a more "flexible" version of something, then detect and require the sugar
