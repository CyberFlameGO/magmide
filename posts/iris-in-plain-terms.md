# A No Nonsense Introduction to the Iris Separation Logic

The Iris Separation Logic is amazing, and I believe it's going to be the secret at the heart of the next generation of truly correct software. The only problem is that it isn't explained in a way *practicing software engineers* can understand. It's explained *extremely* well for programming language researchers (in fact it's explained unusually well), but it's still not quite good enough to cross the mainstream line:

- There isn't a language engineers can actually *use* to play around with and gain an understanding of Iris, so it remains locked in papers.
- The papers describing Iris gloss over math concepts like partial commutative monoids and extension orders and reflexivity. A full explanation of Iris would go over these things first or enough during.
- The papers use difficult to parse and arbitrary symbology rather than helpful "handle" names, so it's difficult to orient oneself while reading it.
